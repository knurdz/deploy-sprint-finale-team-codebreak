| T03 |  |  | `deploy.yml` downloads the CI-built `site-dist-<sha>` artifact (via `actions/download-artifact@v4`, resolving the source CI run from the `workflow_run` event or the GitHub API) instead of rebuilding, writes `release-candidate/artifact.json` recording task/artifact/commit/CI-run-id, publishes it as job summary + `release-manifest-<sha>` artifact, and forwards the artifact identity in the organizer dispatch payload. |
